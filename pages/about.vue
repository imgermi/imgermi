	  			<p class="band__text--p">I started making shitty websites with basic HTML and unreadable CSS in 2016. As soon as I saved that .html file and opened it on the browser, my life changed forever. I became obsessed with the web. I couldn't believe I could create something out of a damn plain-text file, and make it look the way I want.</p>
	  			<p class="band__text--p">After that, all I did was trying to create websites. As much as I could. And I kept doing it until a good-old-friend of my dad asked me to do one for him. I thought 'there's nothing left to loose (mi favorite record ever)', so I did it. And that was the beginning of my getting-into-the-design-field journey.</p>

	  			<p class="band__text--p">After getting some basic projects done, I sent my disgusting portfolio to about 73 companies around the city. Only one replied back, and guess what? One week, two interviews and a small project later, I was on my way to my first day at the office. That was the time I got my first job ever, and it was as a UI Developer. My task was receiving a super-damn-heavy .psd file with a 12 page website and coding it. From top to bottom. Responsive. Light. Fast. Usable.</p>
	  			<p class="band__text--p">I only worked for 9 months on that company, but still to this day I can't believe how much I got to learn throughout those 9 months.</p>
	  			<p class="band__text--p">All of this was just the beginning of my journey.</p>
	  			<p class="band__text--p">Having that strong foundation as a coder gave me incredible tools and skills to build complete solutions. And that's what I've been focused on lately.</p>
	  			<p class="band__text--p">I spend most of my day writing, designing interfaces, whether it's a mobile app or a website, coding a lot of CSS, and trying to solve problems and come up with solutions for start-ups and small businesses.</p>
